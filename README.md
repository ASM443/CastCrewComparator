6/25/22

The purpose of this project is to get my feet wet with web development. This app will will use Rails and Tailwinds and have a Rails API. First I will make a simple ruby project that scrapes the imdb fullcast page then find the cast and crew members in common add their IMDB page to a list. Next I will translate the project to a rails app with a pretty interface using Tail winds.
